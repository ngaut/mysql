# Index merge tests

# Last update:
# 2006-08-07 ML test refactored (MySQL 5.1)
#               Main code of several index_merge tests
#                            -> include/index_merge*.inc
#               wrapper t/index_merge_innodb.test sources now several 
#               include/index_merge*.inc files

--source include/have_innodb.inc
let $engine_type= InnoDB;
# According to Oracle: "InnoDB's estimate for the index cardinality
# depends on a pseudo random number generator (it picks up random
# pages to sample). After an optimization that was made in r2625 two
# EXPLAINs started returning a different number of rows (3 instead of
# 4)", so:
let $index_merge_random_rows_in_EXPLAIN = 1;
# InnoDB does not support Merge tables (affects include/index_merge1.inc)
let $merge_table_support= 0;

# The first two tests are disabled because of non deterministic explain output.
# If include/index_merge1.inc can be enabled for InnoDB and all other
# storage engines, please remove the subtest for Bug#21277 from
# include/index_merge2.inc.
# This test exists already in include/index_merge1.inc.
